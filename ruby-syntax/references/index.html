  <p className="recipe-description-p">
    Sauteed Chinese Broccoli is a mainstay in our kitchen. It goes with just about everything as a side dish!
    
    To cook it, we use a Cantonese method perfected over the years from watching my parents cook at home and in the family
    Chinese restaurant.
    
    This version uses clear rice wine, plenty of ginger and garlic, and high heat to build wok hei flavor and amplify the
    natural flavor of the greens.

  <h2 name="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
  <ol className="recipe-ingredient-list">
    <li>1 pound Chinese broccoli (washed thoroughly, ends trimmed and cut at an angle into 2- to 2½-inch pieces)</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon sugar</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
    <li>1/8 teaspoon MSG or mushroom powder (optional)</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons oil (any neutral flavored oil, such as vegetable or canola oil)</li>
    <li>7 slices fresh ginger (thin slices)</li>
    <li>4 cloves garlic (sliced)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon clear rice wine (can also use Shaoxing wine, though clear rice wine yields a cleaner, milder flavor)</li>
  </ol>
  <h2 name="directions">Directions</h2>
  <ol className="recipe-directions">
    <li>First, prepare the Chinese broccoli. Wash them thoroughly in a big bowl of water, agitating the water and rubbing the
    leaves to loosen any dirt. Then allow them to soak for about 5-10 minutes to allow the dirt/sand to settle at the bottom
    of the bowl. Repeat twice, for a total of three washings.</li>
    <li>Trim away any tough ends. Larger, thicker gai lan stems can get tough at the bottom of the stalk, so trim a ¼-inch off
    the ends, and use a paring knife or peeler to remove the outer layer of the bottom stem (which can be too fibrous to
    eat), similar to what you would do with asparagus. Then slice on a diagonal into 2 to 2 ½ inch pieces.</li>
    <li>If desired, mix the salt, sugar, white pepper, and msg (if using), so you can add them to the vegetables all at once.
    When you’re stir-frying, you want everything close at hand so you can focus on building wok hei.</li>
    <li>Heat your wok over medium-high until it’s just smoking. Spread the oil around the perimeter of the wok. Add the ginger
    slices, and cook for 10-15 seconds, or until they’re fragrant and just starting to caramelize (this will happen very
    quickly if your heat is high enough).</li>
    <li>Add the garlic, followed immediately by the Chinese broccoli. Using a scooping motion, stir-fry with your wok spatula
    for 10 seconds to coat everything in the oil and evenly distribute the ginger and garlic.</li>
    <li>Increase the heat to high. Add the clear rice wine around the perimeter of the wok.</li>
    <li>Push all of the Chinese broccoli into the middle of the wok in a small pile. Cover the wok for 1 minute. Steam will cook
    the vegetables, and the sides of your wok should superheat.</li>
    <li>Remove the wok lid. Gripping the wok by the handle, use your spatula to drag the Chinese broccoli around the sides of
    the wok. This will create a searing, wok hei effect. Next add the salt, sugar, white pepper and msg (if using).</li>
    <li>Stir-fry for another 30 seconds, or until the gai lan has reached the desired tenderness. If the vegetables look too dry
    at this point, add a splash of hot water or chicken stock. Serve.</li>
